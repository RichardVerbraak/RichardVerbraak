Hello there, I'm Richard! 🖖
---

📖 I love and live to learn and especially to dive in deep to see what's really under the hood.

👩🏻‍💻 I program mostly in React and lately TypeScript, I also have a penchant for creating FullStack apps with Node.js (Express) and MongoDB as my backend.

⭐️ In terms of Design - I love making sites look clean and modern with just a dash of animation while taking note of core Design Principles.

Currently I'm studying Datastructures and Algorithms to lay a better foundation for myself and ultimately trying to be the best I can be as a programmer!
